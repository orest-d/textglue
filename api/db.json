{"snippets":{"2019-03-31_1":"","2019-03-31":"TextGlue is based on these design principles:\n- Simplicity above all.\n- Use simple text only. (Perhaps markdown in the future.)\n- Simple text files for storing. Allow to remove, add and edit in any text editors.\n- Metadata in yaml files - as well easily editable/hackable.\n- Low friction. Start new text by a single click. No name, folder or chapter selection necessary. All these can be done later.\n- Organize later.\n- Keep text in snippets as long as possible - even when chapters are already formed.","textglue":"TextGlue is a simplistic text editor for writers.\nOr maybe just for a single writer - for me...\n\nOnce upon the time I decided to write a book. I have never done that before. Writing is hard and the worst is to know what to write.\nSometimes you just stair at the keyboard for hours writing the same sentence, deleting it and writing again... At least that's how it looks in sitcoms.\nI have to admit, I was terrified of writing. So I decided to do use a couple of tricks:\n- I will write whatever comes to my mind (keeping the \"whatever\" in line with the topic of the book.)\n- I will use plane text files - no formatting, no nonsense that would distract me from writing.\nIt worked for a while. I think by now I have about hundred pages of text. But it is terribly unstructured - it is just a collection of text snippets. They somehow cover the topics I wanted to cover,\nbut they have two big problems: a) they overlap and b) they are not ordered in any way.\n\nAt the same time I got another problem: I wanted to learn a couple of things - namely rust, vue and webassembly. Hence the TextGlue was born!\nI could learn what I wanted to learn on a reasonably small project - and I will solve my little writing problem as well. That's called synergy!\n\n\n"},"metadata":{"2019-03-31_1":{"name":"Structure","summary":"Explanation of how TextGlue is organized","tags":["structure"]},"textglue":{"name":"TextGlue Story","summary":"Little story about how TextGlue started","tags":["story","intro"]},"2019-03-31":{"name":"Design","summary":"Design principles behind TextGlue","tags":["design"]}},"documents":{"document":{"name":"Document","chapters":[{"name":"Introduction","snippets":["textglue","2019-03-31"]},{"name":"Structure","snippets":["2019-03-31_1"]}]}}}
